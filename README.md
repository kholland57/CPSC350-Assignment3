Assignment 3

List of Source Files:
  1) SyntaxCheck.h
  2) SyntaxCheck.cpp
  3) main.cpp
  4) GenStack.h

References:
- Zybooks, especially Chapter 13- Templates.
- The GenStack was based on the in-class example we walked through, with
a lot of the same methods
- In SyntaxCheck.cpp for the method checkSyntax(), I referenced from the Data Structures and Algorithms, C++ 2nd Edition book by Goodrich. I closely referenced the pseudo code in chapter 5.1, Stacks on page 205 to check the brackets and implement the stacks.
